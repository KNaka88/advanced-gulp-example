This repo is a tool for my Treehouse course on Gulp.

This code was generated with the [generator-gulp-angular](https://github.com/Swiip/generator-gulp-angular) Yeoman Generator.

## Getting Started
Since the site was already scaffolded with Yeoman, you actually don't need to have it installed.  
But, you should have gulp installed globally:
```
npm install -g gulp
```
Then clone this repo:
```
git clone <this-repo>
```
Install the project's node modules:
```
cd <this-repo>
npm install
```

Now you can run gulp commands!

e.g.:
```
gulp serve
gulp build
#etc!
```
